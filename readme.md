TItle: **Developing and Measuring AI Pluralism: Strategies, Milestones, and Innovative Approaches**

Abstract:

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the development strategies and milestones necessary for realizing AI Pluralism. It begins by reevaluating the transition from GPT to ChatGPT, examining how leveraging trained models to process information channels differently can contribute to the creation of individualized AI agents. Specifically, it explores how different epistemological representations like _belief, knowledge, interpersonal relationships_ can be accounted for in LLMs. The paper explores various approaches to training sets, including the combination of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning, model merging, variations on Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures including specialized routing between experts in the context of AI Pluralism. Through such techniques we propose methods for enabling diverse agent interactions both in terms of AI-Human and AI-AI interactions. Drawing on the traditions of Turing, we suggest language games as a framework for measuring progress. Ranging from simplistic games like 20 questions to sophisticated games like academic debate we study community “tribalistic” environments around cooperative/competitive multi-agent game dynamics. Using evolutionary approaches, such systems are capable of generating new models via model merging, new stored strategies and concepts via private agentic knowledge retrieval graphs, and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Additionally, the paper proposes a set of milestones for measuring progress in AI Pluralism more broadly, introducing new pluralistic parameters and indicators. These milestones include measuring systems' ability to evolve over time while maintaining consistent positionality using a "turn-based" model, developing a graph-based model for understanding relationship clusters, ideologies, and complex interactions within the AI community, and measuring creativity by way of predictability. By outlining these development strategies and milestones, this paper provides a roadmap for the practical implementation and assessment of AI Pluralism, contributing to the advancement of more diverse, adaptable, and innovative AI systems.

**Introduction**



* Define AI Pluralism
* Explain why its important
* Introduce the focus areas of the paper
* Hypothesis 1: AI Pluralism should significantly contribute to the pursuit of AGI and ASI
* Hypothesis 2: AI Pluralism can create natural AI safety mechanisms via community dynamics
* Hypothesis 3: Careful setup of the situation, generative architecture, and retrieval architecture can achieve AI pluralistic benefits.

**The Retrieval Architecture**

_LLMs & Epistemic Primitives_



* Consciousness is not a boolean property
* What are the ingredients of consciousness (Draw upon Dennett here a bit)
* Define Belief (for experimental purposes)
* Define Knowledge (for experimental purposes)
* Define Belief/Knowledge relationships

_Rethinking Retrieval Knowledge Graphs as Agent States_



* Graph Neural Networks as a learnable retrieval mechanism
* Building associations between nodes in the knowledge graph
* Modifying the graph: Adding, relating, retrieving
* Associating Retrieved outputs with prompt templates

**The Generative Architecture**

_MoE as a model for Individuality_



* The value of model merging
* The importance of building appropriate strategies for routing
* Fine-tuning small models for MoE to achieve specific epistemic goals

**The Situation**

_Language Games_



* Defining what a language game is
* 20 questions
* Murder mystery
* Debate
* Math / system of equations competition

_Game Theory and Culture_



* Understanding the effects of agency and interaction
* Agents must be able to update their model of the world
* Agents must have “skin in the game” with some sort of motivating mechanism for “winning”
* Culture and cultural transmission exponentially multiple the power of knowledge
* Variables of Complexity

_Evolutionary Learning_



* Thinking about Merging as Mating 
* Models where capital is always diminishing (zero-sum time based multi-agent games)
* Winners Mate, Losers dont.
* 

**Experimental Design**



* Creating the retrieval structure
* Creating the generative architecture
* Creating the Situation

**Results**

**Discussion**

Dennett vs. Chomsky – what role does language play in consciousness?

How does culture factor in?

Significance of future research with clear objectives

**Milestones**



* Measuring complexity/diversity of the situation
* Measuring progress in terms of total points for various turn-based language games
* Measuring how sophisticated the retrieval mechanisms are

**Conclusion**

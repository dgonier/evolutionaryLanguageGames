Background and Related Work

This section discusses the concept of model merging and its advantages, as well as the challenges and limitations of traditional methods. It explores different techniques for merging image generation and language models, including weight interpolation, task arithmetic, TIES-Merging, and DARE.

Model merging combines the strengths of multiple pre-trained models into a single unified model.
 - Traditional transfer learning is limited to single tasks, while model merging allows for handling various tasks simultaneously.
 - Weight averaging and interpolation have shown significant improvements in image processing and classification models.
 - Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that flatter local optima generalize better to out-of-distribution shifts.
 - Task Arithmetic enables manipulation of merged language models through arithmetic operations on model weights.
 - Interference between model parameters can lead to performance degradation in weight interpolation-based methods.
 - TIES-Merging addresses information loss in merging methods by resetting minimal parameter changes, resolving sign conflicts, and merging aligned parameters.
 - Frankenmerging allows for the creation of new architectures by stacking layers from different models.
